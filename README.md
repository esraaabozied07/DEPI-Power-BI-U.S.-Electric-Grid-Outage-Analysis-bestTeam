# U.S. Power Grid Outage Analysis (2002-2023)

## Overview

This repository contains the Power BI project for analyzing 21 years of electric outage data in the U.S. power grid, from January 2002 to July 2023. The analysis was commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to derive insights from outage trends, quantify impacts, and propose recommendations for improving grid performance and resilience.

The project utilizes Power BI for data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and storytelling to provide actionable insights into outage trends, vulnerabilities, and impacts on customers and demand.

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicates and unnecessary rows.
   - Standardized column formats and values.
   - Categorized events and ensured data consistency.

2. **Data Modeling & Calculation**:
   - Created relationships between tables.
   - Developed DAX measures for metrics like event counts, averages, and YOY comparisons.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Built visuals for trends, patterns, and key metrics.
   - Highlighted outliers and anomalies for better understanding.

4. **Distribution & Automation**:
   - Published reports to Power BI Online.
   - Automated data refreshes for up-to-date insights.

## Objectives

The key objectives of this project include:
- Cleaning and consolidating raw power outage data.
- Uncovering patterns, trends, and anomalies in outage events.
- Quantifying the impacts of outages on customers and demand loss.
- Identifying vulnerabilities and proposing recommendations to improve grid resilience.
- Visualizing insights and trends through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes trends, anomalies, and significant outage events.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles inconsistencies, missing values, and unstructured formats in raw data.
- **Trend Analysis**: Provides year-over-year metrics, rolling averages, and seasonal trends.
- **Event Categorization**: Analyzes outages by type (weather-related, operational, etc.).
- **Outliers Detection**: Detect Outliers (Extreme) Events using Six Sigma.
- **Impact Quantification**: Calculates total customers affected, demand loss, and outage durations.
- **Actionable Insights**: Suggests strategies for improving grid performance and customer communication.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were proposed:
- **Enhance Grid Stability**:
  - Invest in weather-resistant infrastructure.
  - Incorporate predictive maintenance and renewable energy sources.
- **Reduce Outage Durations**:
  - Implement real-time monitoring and self-healing grid technology.
- **Improve Customer Communication**:
  - Utilize real-time notifications and transparent online platforms.
- **Optimize Capacity Planning**:
  - Upgrade aging infrastructure in high-outage areas.

## Data Sources

The dataset originates from the DOE's Form DOE-417 and contains event-level data on:
- Event timings and durations.
- Locations and NERC regions.
- Demand loss and customer impacts.
- Categorized outage types (e.g., weather-related, operational).
